#Epitome 
-----------------------------------
An Instrument Built for Change

http://democracy.foundation/epitome/

-----------------------------------
<p align="justify">Epitome is a direct democracy online platform for societies of every demand or size. It enables the full and non-exclusive participation of citizens and members through an appealing and abundant design. Rather than top-down, government controlled referendums, Epitome is a responsive system in which the individual proposals are subjected to peer evaluation and cultivation along with other proposals, each through their own group of creators and supporters building and improving them.
