# Welcome to the Epitome Project

You have our deep gratitude for deciding to contribute to the development of Epitome. We welcome all contributors and contributions regardless of skill or experience level. We want to make contributing as easy as possible, by providing support to contributors, especially new contributors. This can include providing feedback on your patches among other things.  However by following the guidelines below contributors can decrease the amount of support required, which gives everyone more time to write code and contribute.

##Reporting Bugs and Issues

* **Please first make sure that your issue is not already reported, by using the GitHub issue search** as it would greatly help to gather information about different instances of a single bug.
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. **Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

##Contributing Code

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project and make your changes.

* We encourage testing before merging a pull-request. **Pull Requests should usually be made for the `Development` branch** as this contains the most recent version of the code.

* Push the changes to your fork and [submit a new pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) with a clear list of what you've done and a descriptive title.

* All contributions must be made under the [AGPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license. No transfer of copyright or other rights or permissions is required. All contributors should be listed in the AUTHORS.md file, and all contributors with copyrights must be listed.

##Other Contributions

* If you find something undocumented whose behaviour is unlikely to change, consider filling in that part of the documentation.
